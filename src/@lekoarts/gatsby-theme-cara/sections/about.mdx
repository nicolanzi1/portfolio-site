## About Me!

Looking for my <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href='./Resume Nicola Lanzillotta.pdf' target="\_blank">Resume</a>? Search no more...

I am an Italian/Venezuelan self-taught Software Engineer based in Manchester, with a background in JavaScript/React.js and Ruby on Rails. Beyond code, I am a gamer, a guitar player, and searching for knowledge. I love web development because I get to build incredible things, being hands on the full app's development process.

In 2020, I completed a 12 week course at App Academy, an intensive, full-stack web development program that focuses on Ruby on Rails, JavaScript and React.js, and I'm currently looking for a new job opportunity which will allow me to grow and develop my skills even further.
